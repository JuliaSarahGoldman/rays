2016-09-23: Our First Image
===============================================================

6:45PM stopping for dinner. Will work Sunday again on this at 9AM...
L is not incrementing, although everything that is multiplied together and added to L does not equal 0.

![Something is getting intersected.](2016-09-23_001_starter_r816_g3d_r860__Something_is_getting_intersected_.jpg)

Upon trying a scene that has an actual light source, we see that something is
showing up, but not what we want.

=============================================================

![Cylinder does not appear. No rays intersect?](2016-09-23_000_starter_r816_g3d_r860__Cylinder_does_not_appear__No_rays_intersect_.jpg)



2016-09-23: Work Work Work
=====================================================

![Cornell Box](2016-09-23_002_starter_r816_g3d_r860__Cornell_Box.jpg)

The red is where the rays intersect nothing. The black is where they hit
something. The white is the light.


6:21 pm: We had ++x instead of ++y.

6:03 pm. Attempted to make image appear. Memory error in shade. Possibly having to do with surfel.
We currently are using the existing function for triangle intersection, and are hoping the other functions work.

We realized we had shade() instead of RayTracer::shade() in our cpp file.

On attempting to compile our code, we are given:
Severity	Code	Description	Project	File	Line	Suppression State
Error	LNK2019	unresolved external symbol "public: class G3D::Color3 __cdecl RayTracer::shade(class G3D::Ray,class std::shared_ptr<class G3D::Surfel> const &,class G3D::Array<class std::shared_ptr<class G3D::Light>,10> const &)" (?shade@RayTracer@@QEAA?AVColor3@G3D@@VRay@3@AEBV?$shared_ptr@VSurfel@G3D@@@std@@AEBV?$Array@V?$shared_ptr@VLight@G3D@@@std@@$09@3@@Z) referenced in function "public: class G3D::Color3 __cdecl RayTracer::measureLight(class std::shared_ptr<class G3D::Scene> const &,class G3D::Ray,int,class G3D::EmbreeTriTree const &,class G3D::CPUVertexArray const &)" (?measureLight@RayTracer@@QEAA?AVColor3@G3D@@AEBV?$shared_ptr@VScene@G3D@@@std@@VRay@3@HAEBVEmbreeTriTree@3@AEBVCPUVertexArray@3@@Z)	starter	C:\cs371\2-rays\RayTracer.obj	1	

We have started working at 4:22PM. Let us see what occurs!
We started with the shading function. Wonderful!

2016-09-22: Scheduled Lab Period
=====================================================
Plans: Meet Saturday 1-7 to work.

Start 1:20
1:35 GUI draft done
2:25 Drafts of functions done. (Have parameters, return values and descriptions.)

If we can get an array of surfaces from an entity (in a scene), can we get a TriTree? lastBoxBoundArray?  
2:52 We wrote code to get an array of Tris from a scene. 4:50

2016-09-21: Prep
=====================================================
Met in lab to plan.

Plans:

Class:
RayTracer

Functions:
void rayTrace(G3D::Scene scene, const shared-ptr<camera>& cam; const shared-ptr<Image>& image)
Radiance3 measureLight(const Ray& ray, int numScatters)
void findIntersection(const shared-ptr<UniveralSurfel>& surface, const Ray& ray)



2016-08-12: Formatting Notes
=====================================================

This development journal is for you to maintain a log of your project.
It is in [Markdeep](https://casual-effects.com/markdeep/) format. It is
readable as plain text but will have additional nice formatting when loaded
in a web browser.

Put the newest entry at the top of this file, like a blog. Begin the title of
each section with a date in ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD).

Press F4 or F6 in your G3D program to automatically add screenshots and video to 
this development journal.
