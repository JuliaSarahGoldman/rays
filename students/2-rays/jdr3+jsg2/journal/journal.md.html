![Lip!](2016-09-18_026_starter_r575_g3d_r762__Lip_.jpg)

I now have arrays for radius and height.

At this point, I need to make a new glass method, and keep what was working and not what wasn't.

![Fixed inside-less cup](2016-09-18_012_starter_r575_g3d_r762__Fixed_inside-less_cup.jpg)

i and j mixup

Now, I need to give the glass an inside.

![Problem fixed](2016-09-18_010_starter_r575_g3d_r762__Problem_fixed.jpg)

I realized that when I modded, the effect of add j to the old value disapeared,
and I had to re-add j back in.

![Beginnings of wine glass](2016-09-18_006_starter_r545_g3d_r762__Beginnings_of_wine_glass.jpg)

2:16 Created generateGlass function, which should create points for outsid of glass (so far)

2016-09-18: Hieghtfield
=============================================================

2:08 pm. Heightfield Complete

![Working Heightfield](2016-09-18_005_starter_r545_g3d_r762__Working_Heightfield.jpg)

![Flat heightfield](2016-09-18_004_starter_r545_g3d_r762__Flat_heightfield.jpg)

![Heightfield from above](2016-09-18_003_starter_r545_g3d_r762__Heightfield_from_above.jpg)

Looks better.

![Heightfield with Different holes](2016-09-18_002_starter_r545_g3d_r762__Heightfield_with_Different_holes.jpg)

![Heightfield (with holes)](2016-09-18_001_starter_r545_g3d_r762__Heightfield_(with_holes).jpg)

Time: 2 pm Realized holes in heightfield because faces have points in incorrect order.

![Mysterious Triangles](2016-09-18_000_starter_r545_g3d_r762__Mysterious_Triangles.jpg)

Tested heightfield on solid colroed image. For some reason, generated triangles
instead of quads?

Began work: 12:29 pm.
12:40 pm: Created GUI for heightfield

2016-09-17:
=============================================================
Began work: 1:45 pm.
1:57 pm: Added loops to generate top and bottom for cube, and the OFF file looks good, but top and bottom still don't appear. Will leave alone for now.
Attempted to add GUI for heightfield. Leaving lab at 2:22 pm.

2016-09-15: "Cylinder"
=============================================================

2016-09-15: Scheduled Lab Period
=====================================================
Set up svn for lab.
Completed report draft and white cube model file. (I don't think further drafts of the cube will be needed, although position could change.)
Created functions for cylinder and heightfield (although parameters for heightfield will probably change.)

I am now going to attempt to write an algorithm to generate the vertices of the cylinder.
I can generate what would seem to be the vertices of the cylinder.
Realized vertices being generated wrong due to parenthesis mix up.
Generated code for faces.

Successfully constructed cylinder sans top and bottom.
Lab period over. 4:10 pm.

2016-09-14: Prep Work
=====================================================
Arrived at lab at about 7:45 pm (having already read through lab and done some thinking). Some delay due to impact testing going on in lab. Made preliminary workflow table by hand. Got on computer at about 8:05 pm. Used svn to set up new folder for lab, and copied folders over from starter (although may use 0-cubes instead?). Created blank document for report.

Created Workflow table, added heading to report.
Left lab at 8:52 pm

2016-08-12: Formatting Notes
=====================================================

This development journal is for you to maintain a log of your project.
It is in [Markdeep](https://casual-effects.com/markdeep/) format. It is
readable as plain text but will have additional nice formatting when loaded
in a web browser.

Put the newest entry at the top of this file, like a blog. Begin the title of
each section with a date in ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD).

Press F4 or F6 in your G3D program to automatically add screenshots and video to 
this development journal.
