Questions
================================
1. The intersection could be derived from the system of equations formed from the equation that describes a ray and the equation that defines a cylinder, $x^2 + y^2 = r^2$. To solve for the top and bottom of the cylinder, we would just use the equation for a 3D ellipsoid with no height, which is $x^2 + y^2 = 1$.
2. For a non-analytic surface, one can compute the intersection with the ray using what is essentially a binary search. If at one point the ray is on the outside of the surface and at another it is on the inside, the ray must interest the surface somwhere in between. By continually looking at the halfway point between two points and then determining which side of it teh intersect is on, one can approximate the intersection to a chosen degree.
3. As seen in question two, finding an intersection is essentially binary searching. Thus, if you root your tree at the center of a surface, this becomes easier.
