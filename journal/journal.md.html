2016-08-12: Formatting Notes
=====================================================

This development journal is for you to maintain a log of your project.
It is in [Markdeep](https://casual-effects.com/markdeep/) format. It is
readable as plain text but will have additional nice formatting when loaded
in a web browser.

Put the newest entry at the top of this file, like a blog. Begin the title of
each section with a date in ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD).

Press F4 or F6 in your G3D program to automatically add screenshots and video to
